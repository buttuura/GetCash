# Commands to Upload Your Project to GitHub

# After creating your repository on GitHub, run these commands:

# 1. Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/task-management-app.git

# 2. Rename branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# 3. Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Example with actual username:
# git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/task-management-app.git
# git branch -M main  
# git push -u origin main

# That's it! Your project will be on GitHub and ready for deployment.
