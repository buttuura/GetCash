# Upload Your GetCash Project to GitHub

# Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username and run these commands:

# 1. Add your GetCash repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/GetCash.git

# 2. Rename branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# 3. Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Example if your username is "johndoe":
# git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/GetCash.git
# git branch -M main
# git push -u origin main

# After successful upload, your project will be at:
# https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/GetCash

# Then we can deploy it to Render.com for free hosting!
